# WebCodecs

The [WebCodecs API](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/) allows web applications
to encode and decode audio and video.

Many Web APIs use media codecs internally to support APIs for particular uses:
- HTMLMediaElement and Media Source Extensions
- WebAudio (decodeAudioData)
- MediaRecorder
- WebRTC

But thereâ€™s no general way to flexibly configure and use these media codecs.
Because of this, many web applications have resorted to implementing
media codecs in JavaScript or WebAssembly, despite the disadvantages:
- Increased bandwidth to download codecs already in the browser.
- Reduced performance
- Reduced power efficiency

It's great for:
- Live streaming
- Cloud gaming
- Media file editing and transcoding

## WebCodecs registries

This repository also contains two registries:

* The [WebCodecs Codec Registry](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/codec_registry.html)
provides the means to identify and avoid collisions among codec strings
used in WebCodecs and provides a mechanism to define codec-specific members of
WebCodecs codec configuration dictionaries. Codec-specific registrations entered
in the registry are also maintained in the repository, please refer to the
registry for a comprehensive list.

* The [WebCodecs VideoFrame Metadata Registry](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/video_frame_metadata_registry.html)
enumerates the metadata fields that can be attached to
[VideoFrame](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/#videoframe-interface) objects via the
[VideoFrameMetadata](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/#dictdef-videoframemetadata) dictionary.
Metadata registrations entered in the registry may be maintained in this repository
or elsewhere. Please refer to the registry for a comprehensive list.
